Your code uses the following GPIO pins:

TRIG_PIN (GPIO 23) – This pin is used to trigger the ultrasonic sensor by sending a short pulse.
ECHO_PIN (GPIO 24) – This pin receives the reflected pulse from the ultrasonic sensor, allowing the program to calculate the distance.

The Pixhawk is connected via the serial port /dev/serial0, which corresponds to the UART pins on the Raspberry Pi. These pins are:

TX (GPIO 14 / UART0 TXD) – Transmits data from the Raspberry Pi to the Pixhawk.
RX (GPIO 15 / UART0 RXD) – Receives data from the Pixhawk to the Raspberry Pi.
GND – A shared ground connection to ensure proper communication.
Your code initializes this connection with:

python
Copy
Edit
pixhawk = mavutil.mavlink_connection('/dev/serial0', baud=115200)
